- [ ] Repository: https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio ready
- [ ] Docker Hub account active

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Initial Pipeline Test

### Method 1: Manual Trigger
1. Go to: https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio/actions
2. Click **"SRE CI/CD Pipeline"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select **"main"** branch
5. Click **"Run workflow"** button

### Method 2: Automatic Trigger (Alternative)
1. Make a small change to trigger the pipeline
2. Push to main branch
3. Pipeline will start automatically

### Expected Timeline:
- **Quality Gates**: 2-3 minutes
- **Build & Push**: 4-6 minutes
- **Deploy**: 3-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes

---

## ðŸ“Š Phase 2: Pipeline Stage Monitoring

### Stage 1: Quality Gates âœ…
**Expected Actions:**

- [ ] Linting analysis (Flake8, pylint)
- [ ] Security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- [ ] Unit tests execution (11 tests)
- [ ] Coverage reporting (target: >85%)

**Success Indicators:**
- All checks pass with green âœ…
- Test coverage report generated
- Security scan completes (warnings OK)

### Stage 2: Build & Push âœ…
**Expected Actions:**
- [ ] Docker image build
- [ ] Multi-architecture support
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
- [ ] Image push to Docker Hub
- [ ] Tag with commit SHA and timestamp

**Success Indicators:**
- Docker image builds successfully
- No critical vulnerabilities found
- Image appears in Docker Hub with correct tags

### Stage 3: Infrastructure Validation âœ…
**Expected Actions:**
- [ ] Terraform syntax validation
- [ ] Infrastructure security checks
- [ ] Resource provisioning (if AWS configured)
- [ ] Compliance verification

**Success Indicators:**
- Terraform validation passes
- Security compliance checks complete
- Infrastructure ready for deployment

### Stage 4: Deployment Strategy âœ…
**Expected Actions:**
- [ ] Rolling deployment execution
- [ ] Health check validation
- [ ] Load balancer configuration
- [ ] Auto-scaling setup
- [ ] Rollback preparation

**Success Indicators:**
- Deployment completes without errors
- Health checks pass
- Application accessible
- Metrics collection active

### Stage 5: Post-Deployment Validation âœ…
**Expected Actions:**
- [ ] SLO monitoring activation
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Alert rule deployment
- [ ] Notification system test

**Success Indicators:**
- All health endpoints responding
- Metrics flowing to monitoring system
- Alerts configured and active
- Notifications sent successfully

### Stage 6: Chaos Engineering âœ…
**Expected Actions:**
- [ ] Resilience test execution
- [ ] Failure simulation
- [ ] Recovery validation
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

**Success Indicators:**
- Chaos tests complete successfully
- System recovers from induced failures
- Performance remains within SLO bounds
- Recovery time meets targets

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Phase 3: Monitoring Integration Verification

### Prometheus Metrics Check
**Verify these endpoints:**
- Application metrics: `/metrics`
- Health check: `/health`
- API functionality: `/api/users`

### Grafana Dashboard Access
**Check monitoring stack:**
- Prometheus: Port 9090
- Grafana: Port 3000
- AlertManager: Port 9093
- Node Exporter: Port 9100

### Expected Metrics:
- [ ] HTTP request rates and latency
- [ ] Error rates by endpoint
- [ ] Application performance metrics
- [ ] Infrastructure metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- [ ] Custom SRE metrics

---

## ðŸ”§ Phase 4: Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Docker Push Fails:**
- Verify DOCKER_USERNAME is correct
- Ensure DOCKER_PASSWORD is access token, not password
- Check Docker Hub account is active

**Tests Fail:**
- Review test logs in GitHub Actions
- Check if all dependencies are installed
- Verify Python version compatibility

**AWS Deployment Issues:**
- Verify AWS credentials are valid
- Check IAM permissions
- Confirm AWS_REGION is correct

**Monitoring Not Working:**
- Check if ports are accessible
- Verify Prometheus configuration
- Confirm Grafana data sources

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

### Pipeline Success:
- [ ] All 6 stages complete successfully
- [ ] Green checkmarks on all jobs
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Docker image pushed to registry

### Monitoring Success:
- [ ] Prometheus collecting metrics
- [ ] Grafana dashboard accessible
- [ ] Alerts configured and functioning
- [ ] Health checks responding

### SRE Success:
- [ ] SLO monitoring active
- [ ] Error budgets tracking
- [ ] Incident response ready
- [ ] Chaos engineering validated

---

## ðŸ“‹ Post-Test Actions

After successful pipeline execution:

1. **Review Logs**: Check all stage logs for warnings
2. **Verify Artifacts**: Confirm Docker images in registry
3. **Test Endpoints**: Validate application accessibility
4. **Monitor Dashboards**: Check Grafana for data flow
5. **Document Results**: Record performance metrics
6. **Plan Next Steps**: Identify areas for optimization

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase: Production Deployment

Once testing succeeds:
- Configure production environment
- Set up additional monitoring
- Implement alerting rules
- Establish incident response procedures
- Plan capacity scaling strategies

---

**Testing Status**: Ready to execute âš¡  
**Prerequisites**: GitHub secrets configuration  
**Expected Duration**: 15-20 minutes total  
**Success Rate**: 95%+ with proper secret configuration
