# Incident Response & Chaos Engineering Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for incident response management and chaos engineering experiments to improve system resilience.

## Features

### Incident Response
- **Incident Commander Dashboard**: Central command interface for incident management
- **Runbook Automation**: Automated execution of common incident response procedures
- **Communication Templates**: Standardized templates for incident communication
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Tools for conducting effective post-mortems
- **Alert Correlation**: Intelligent alert grouping and correlation engine

### Chaos Engineering
- **Chaos Experiments**: Library of pre-built chaos experiments
- **Safe Experiment Framework**: Controls and safeguards for running chaos experiments
- **Impact Assessment**: Tools to measure blast radius and impact
- **Automated Rollback**: Safety mechanisms for experiment failures
- **Experiment Scheduler**: Automated scheduling of chaos experiments
