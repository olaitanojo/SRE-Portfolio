# 🚀 SRE CI/CD Pipeline Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the comprehensive SRE CI/CD pipeline to GitHub and configure all necessary secrets for full automation.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Docker Hub account
- AWS account (for cloud deployments)
- Slack workspace (for notifications)

## 🏗️ Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `SRE-Portfolio`
3. Description: `Comprehensive SRE CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring and Chaos Engineering`
4. Set to **Public** (for portfolio visibility)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 🔧 Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio.git

# Rename master to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push develop branch  
git push -u origin develop
```

## 🔐 Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to: `https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these 8 required secrets:

### 🐳 Docker Registry (2 secrets)
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password/access token

### ☁️ AWS Credentials (3 secrets)  
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`)

### 📧 Notifications (2 secrets)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack webhook URL for notifications
- `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` - Email address for alerts

### 🔐 SSH Keys (1 secret)
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for secure deployments

## 🎯 Step 4: Trigger CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline will automatically trigger on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

You can also manually trigger it:
1. Go to: https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio/actions
2. Select "SRE CI/CD Pipeline"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## 🏃‍♂️ Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline includes these comprehensive stages:

### 🔍 Quality Gates
- Code formatting (black, isort)
- Linting (flake8, pylint)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety)
- Unit tests with coverage
- Integration tests

### 🐳 Build & Registry
- Docker image build
- Security scanning (trivy)
- Multi-architecture builds
- Push to Docker Hub

### ☁️ Infrastructure
- Terraform validation
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Security compliance checks

### 🚀 Deployment Strategies
- **Rolling Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Full environment switching
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual traffic shifting with monitoring

### 🔬 Chaos Engineering
- Infrastructure resilience testing
- Application fault injection
- Recovery validation

### 📊 Monitoring & Alerting
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboard deployment
- Alert manager configuration
- Health check validation

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
sre-cicd-pipeline/
├── .github/workflows/          # GitHub Actions workflows
│   ├── ci-cd-pipeline.yml     # Main SRE pipeline
│   └── sre-pipeline.yml       # Legacy pipeline
├── app/                       # Flask application
├── tests/                     # Test suites
├── monitoring/                # Prometheus, Grafana configs
├── infrastructure/            # Terraform configurations
├── scripts/                   # Deployment scripts
└── docker-compose.yml         # Local monitoring stack
```

## 🎊 Success Indicators

After deployment, verify:

✅ **GitHub Actions**: All workflow steps pass  
✅ **Docker Hub**: Image successfully pushed  
✅ **AWS**: Infrastructure provisioned (if configured)  
✅ **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana accessible  
✅ **Alerts**: Notification channels working  
✅ **Security**: All scans pass with acceptable results  

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Monitor the pipeline execution
2. Review security scan results
3. Validate monitoring dashboards
4. Test deployment strategies
5. Configure additional environments (staging, prod)

## 📞 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
3. Ensure AWS/Docker Hub credentials have proper permissions
4. Review infrastructure requirements
5. Check network connectivity for external services
