## 🚀 Testing the Pipeline

### After configuring secrets, test the pipeline:

1. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/olaitanojo/SRE-Portfolio/actions
   - Click "SRE CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" branch → "Run workflow"

2. **Automatic Trigger**:
   - Make any small change to the repository
   - Commit and push to main branch
   - Pipeline will trigger automatically

### Expected Pipeline Duration:
- **Quality Gates**: 2-3 minutes
- **Build & Push**: 3-5 minutes  
- **Deploy**: 2-5 minutes (varies by strategy)
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### ✅ Pipeline should complete these stages:
- [ ] Code formatting and linting passes
- [ ] Security scans complete (may have warnings)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (11/11 tests)
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Image pushes to Docker Hub
- [ ] Deployment strategy executes
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Notifications sent (if configured)

### 📊 Check these locations for results:
- GitHub Actions tab: Workflow execution logs
- Docker Hub: New image pushed with timestamp tag
- Email: Deployment notifications (if configured)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Docker push fails**: Check DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD
- **AWS errors**: Verify AWS credentials and region
- **Test failures**: Check local test results first
- **Timeout**: Some stages may need more time initially

### Getting Help:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Verify secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure Docker Hub account is active
- For AWS: Verify IAM permissions

## 📋 Quick Start (Minimum Configuration)

For immediate testing, configure just these 3 secrets:
1. ✅ DOCKER_USERNAME
2. ✅ DOCKER_PASSWORD  
3. ✅ NOTIFICATION_EMAIL

This enables core CI/CD functionality!
